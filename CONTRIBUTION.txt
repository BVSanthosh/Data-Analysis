Individual Report
For this practical the approach was to create a list of requirements and then assign each person a certain number to complete. 
We then had a series of deadlines throughout the development period where we had to complete certain requirements. To ensure that 
the development was going smoothly we had occasional meetings in the labs where we would keep each other in-check and assisted each 
other when needed.

As of my contribution, I mainly worked in implementing the additional requirements. I wrote code to analyse the pattern of user activity. 
I had calculations for the reply, tweet, retweet, friend, and follower count for the given user. And I was able to plot these data values 
as a line graph. So by simply entering the username, all the relevant information of the userâ€™s activity will be displayed.
